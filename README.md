Airlines Hacking: This research paper examines critical vulnerabilities in modern aviation systems, focusing on three key areas: Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) systems, in-flight wifi networks, and maintenance system exploits .
ADS-B is essential for modern air traffic control but lacks encryption and authentication, making it susceptible to spoofing and jamming. Studies show that attackers can inject false aircraft data using inexpensive SDR (Software Defined Radio) hardware. Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines, have achieved 83% accuracy in detecting spoofed ADS-B messages.
